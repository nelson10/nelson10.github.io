3D modeling based on point clouds requires ground-filtering algorithms that separate ground from non-ground objects. This study presents two ground filtering algorithms. The first one is based on normal vectors. It has two variants depending on the procedure to compute the k-nearest neighbors. The second algorithm is based on transforming the cloud points into a voxel structure. To evaluate them, the two algorithms are compared according to their execution time, effectiveness and efficiency. Results show that the ground filtering algorithm based on the voxel structure is faster in terms of execution time, effectiveness, and efficiency than the normal vector ground filtering.
