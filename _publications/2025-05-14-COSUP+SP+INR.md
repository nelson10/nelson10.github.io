Single-shot, high-speed 2D optical imaging is essential for studying transient phenomena in
various research fields. Among existing techniques, compressed optical-streaking ultra-highspeed photography (COSUP) uses a coded aperture and a galvanometer scanner to capture
non-repeatable time-evolving events at the 1.5 million-frame-per-second level. However, the use
of a random coded aperture complicates the reconstruction process and introduces artifacts in
the recovered videos. In contrast, non-multiplexing coded apertures simplify the reconstruction
algorithm, allowing the recovery of longer videos from a snapshot. In this work, we design a
non-multiplexing coded aperture for COSUP by exploiting the properties of congruent sphere
packing (SP), which enables uniform space-time sampling given by the synergy between the
galvanometer linear scanning and the optimal SP encoding patterns. We also develop an implicit
neural representation—which can be self-trained from a single measurement—to not only largely
reduce the training time and eliminate the need for training datasets, but also reconstruct far more
ultra-high-speed frames from a single measurement. The advantages of this proposed encoding
and reconstruction scheme are verified by simulations and experimental results in a COSUP
system.
