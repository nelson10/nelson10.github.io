This chapter provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the rolling shutter (RS) mechanism found in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensors as a coding opportunity for high-speed videos. Based on this, we present a cutting-edge readout architecture called shuffled rolling shutter (SRS) that optimally designs the scanlines entries of the RS for improved sampling of the space-time datacube. The RS restriction implies that only one entry per column is sampled at each exposure time. This restriction can be modeled using a three-dimensional N2 queens problem (3DN2QP), such that the optimal design of entries is computed straightforwardly, solving a sphere packing (SP) problem. The main advantage of packing equal-size spheres in a cubic container is promoting uniform spatiotemporal sampling. Simulation and experimental results prove that with the captured measurements using the proposed SRS, we can recover the underlying video from a snapshot. This opens the avenue for the development of new CMOS imaging detectors with shuffled positions of the RS, now able to turn a typical nuisance into an opportunity to capture and recover videos from snapshots.
