<div style="text-align: justify">I got my B.Sc. (Eng.), M.Sc. degree in Computer Science, and the Ph.D. degree in Engineering with an emphasis in Electronics from the Universidad Industrial de Santander, <a href="https://www.uis.edu.co/webUIS/es/index.jsp">UIS</a>, Bucaramanga, Colombia, in 2012, 2015, and 2020, respectively. During my Ph.D. (2016-2019), I designed, simulated, and implemented adaptive systems for compressive spectral imaging for different tasks. Between those tasks are hyperspectral and multispectral image classification, image reconstruction, and video sensing. I was under the supervision of Ph.D. <a href="http://hdspgroup.com/">Henry Arguello</a>. My research topics are compressive spectral imaging, adaptive sensing, and video sensing. In autumn-winter 2018-2019, I did an internship with Telecommunications for Space and Aeronautics Laboratory <a href="https://www.tesa.prd.fr/">TéSA</a>, Toulouse, France, funded by <a href="https://minciencias.gov.co/">Minciencias</a>. During my internship, I developed a new algorithm for cardiac motion estimation in ultrasound imaging under the supervision of Ph.D. <a href="http://tourneret.perso.enseeiht.fr/">Jean-Yves Tourneret</a>, and <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Adrian.Basarab/">Adrian Basarab</a>. Currently, I hold a postdoctoral position at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, <a href="https://www.pucv.cl/">PUCV</a>, Valparíso, Chile.  In my postdoc, I am developing sensing schemes for video and spectral acquisition under the supervision of Ph.D <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymoqnSgAAAAJ&hl=en">Esteban Vera</a>.</div>
